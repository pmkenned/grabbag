<p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating pleasure
and extolling pain arose. To do so, I will give you a complete account of the
system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth,
the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes or avoids
pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how
to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in
which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to
obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man
who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? [33] On the other hand, we
denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that
they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal
blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which
is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.  These cases are
perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of
choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we
like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in
certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of
business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and
annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to
this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.</p>
